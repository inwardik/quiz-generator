## Python (Programming Language)

#### Q1. What is an abstract class?

- [ ] An abstract class is the name for any class from which you can instantiate an object.
- [ ] Abstract classes must be redefined any time an object is instantiated from them.
- [ ] Abstract classes must inherit from concrete classes.
- [x] An abstract class exists only so that other "concrete" classes can inherit from the abstract class.

#### Q3. What data structure does a binary tree degenerate to if it isn't balanced properly?

- [x] linked list
- [ ] queue
- [ ] set
- [ ] OrderedDict

#### Q4. What statement about static methods is true?

- [ ] Static methods are called static because they always return `None`.
- [ ] Static methods can be bound to either a class or an instance of a class.
- [x] Static methods serve mostly as utility methods or helper methods, since they can't access or modify a class's state.
- [ ] Static methods can access and modify the state of a class or an instance of a class.

#### Q5. What are attributes?

- [ ] Attributes are long-form version of an (if/else) statement, used when testing for equality between objects.
- [x] Attributes are a way to hold data or describe a state for a class or an instance of a class.
- [ ] Attributes are strings that describe characteristics of a class.
- [ ] Function arguments are called "attributes" in the context of class methods and instance methods.

#### Q8. What is one of the most common use of Python's sys library?

- [x] to capture command-line arguments given at a file's runtime
- [ ] to connect various systems, such as connecting a web front end, an API service, a database, and a mobile app
- [ ] to take a snapshot of all the packages and libraries in your virtual environment
- [ ] to scan the health of your Python ecosystem while inside a virtual environment

#### Q9. What is the runtime of accessing a value in a dictionary by using its key?

- [ ] O(n), also called linear time.
- [ ] O(log n), also called logarithmic time.
- [ ] O(n^2), also called quadratic time.
- [x] O(1), also called constant time.

#### Q20. Which statement does NOT describe the object-oriented programming concept of encapsulation?

- [ ] It protects the data from outside interference.
- [ ] A parent class is encapsulated and no data from the parent class passes on to the child class.
- [ ] It keeps data and the methods that can manipulate that data in one place.
- [x] It only allows the data to be changed by methods.

#### Q21. What is the purpose of an if/else statement?

- [ ] An if/else statement tells the computer which chunk of code to run if the instructions you coded are incorrect
- [ ] An if/else statement runs one chunk of code if all the imports were successful, and another chunk of code if the imports were not successful
- [x] An if/else statement executes one chunk of code if a condition it true, but a different chunk of code if the condition is false
- [ ] An if/else statement tells the computer which chunk of code to run if the is enough memory to handle it. and which chunk of code to run if there is not enough memory to handle it

#### Q24. What does the built-in map() function do?

- [ ] It creates a path from multiple values in an iterable to a single value.
- [x] It applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns the value of that function.
- [ ] It converts a complex value type into simpler value types.
- [ ] It creates a mapping between two different elements of different iterables.

#### Q25. If you don't explicitly return a value from a function, what happens?

- [ ] The function will return a RuntimeError if you don't return a value.
- [x] If the return keyword is absent, the function will return None.
- [ ] If the return keyword is absent, the function will return True.
- [ ] The function will enter an infinite loop because it won't know when to stop executing its code.

#### Q26. What is the purpose of the (pass) statement in Python?

- [ ] It is used to skip the (yield) statement of a generator and return a value of None.
- [x] It is a null operation used mainly as a placeholder in functions, classes, etc.
- [ ] It is used to pass control from one statement block to another.
- [ ] It is used to skip the rest of a (while) or (for loop) and return to the start of the loop.

#### Q27. What is the term used to describe items that may be passed into a function?

- [x] arguments
- [ ] paradigms
- [ ] attributes
- [ ] decorators

#### Q29. When does a for loop stop iterating?

- [ ] when it encounters an infinite loop
- [ ] when it encounters an if/else statement that contains a break keyword
- [x] when it has assessed each item in the iterable it is working on or a break keyword is encountered
- [ ] when the runtime for the loop exceeds O(n^2)

#### Q30. Assuming the node is in a singly linked list, what is the runtime complexity of searching for a specific node within a singly linked list?

- [x] The runtime is O(n) because in the worst case, the node you are searching for is the last node, and every node in the linked list must be visited.
- [ ] The runtime is O(nk), with n representing the number of nodes and k representing the amount of time it takes to access each node in memory.
- [ ] The runtime cannot be determined unless you know how many nodes are in the singly linked list.
- [ ] The runtime is O(1) because you can index directly to a node in a singly linked list.
